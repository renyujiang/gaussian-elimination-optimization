## Description

Gaussian elimination is a widely used algorithm in linear algebra that helps to solve
systems of linear equations. It is a step-by-step procedure that reduces a system of linear
equations to an equivalent system that is easier to solve.
The algorithm works by performing a sequence of computations on an augmented
matrix, which is a matrix that includes both the coefficients of the variables and the
constants of the equations. The goal of Gaussian elimination is to transform the
augmented matrix into row echelon form, which means that the leading coefficient (the
first non-zero entry) of each row is to the right of the leading coefficient of the row above
it. After transforming the matrix into row echelon form, back-substitution can be used to
solve these equations.
